# React + TypeScript + Vite + Prettier

This template is boilerplate code to set up a React, TypeScript, Vite and Prettier project. It includes a template for GitHub issues as well as a workflow folder configured to run linting and testing before each push to main branch.

The components and styles folder contain all the CSS required for each component, and all components on the main branch have full component testing.

#### How to use

To use, clone a copy of this repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DaveBunyan1/react-template
```

and then rename the folder to the desired name.
